Pomme is a from-scratch Minecraft: Java Edition client built entirely in Rust.
It connects to vanilla servers, plays singleplayer worlds on an embedded Rust
server, renders the world through Vulkan, and handles physics, networking,
audio, and UI without any Mojang code. The goal is a lightweight, performant
alternative to the official Java client.

## Features

- **Vulkan rendering**: chunk meshing, GPU frustum and cave-occlusion culling, smooth lighting, water/lava, entities and mobs with skins, block entities, dropped items, particles, weather, clouds, sky, block overlays, hand animation
- **Vanilla-exact physics**: movement, collision, swimming, and drowning matched line by line against the decompiled source
- **Multi-version protocol support**: connects to vanilla servers from 1.20 through 26.3, with per-version packet-id and registry tables generated from the decompiled reference; other versions are translated to the native 26.2 wire layout
- **Singleplayer**: worlds run on [SteelMC](https://github.com/Steel-Foundation/SteelMC), a Rust server embedded in the client and joined over an in-memory pipe; create, edit, and delete worlds from the menu
- **Audio**: vanilla sound events, music, and subtitles through OpenAL Soft
- **Resource packs**: local packs plus server-sent packs, applied live with a remesh
- **Microsoft authentication**: sign in with your Microsoft account, tokens stored in the OS keyring
- **HUD & menus**: health, hunger, air, status effects, hotbar, boss bars, titles, waypoints, F3 debug, chat, pause menu, options, server list, world list
- **Discord presence** for the menu, servers, and worlds
- **Launcher**: Tauri-based launcher with frosted glass UI, multi-account management, Mojang patch notes, installation manager

## Architecture

```bash
pomme-client/         # Minecraft client (Rust, Vulkan)
pomme-launcher/       # Launcher app (Tauri, React, TypeScript)
pomme-protocol/       # Per-version protocol data and wire encoding
pomme-block/          # Data-free stand-in for azalea-block; block tables are Pomme's own
pomme-singleplayer/   # Runs SteelMC in-process as the integrated server
pomme-gpu-allocator/  # Vendored fork of the gpu-allocator crate
third_party/SteelMC/  # SteelMC submodule
tools/                # protogen, blockgen, stategen, and the OpenAL fetch script
```

The client is a standalone binary that receives launch arguments from
the launcher. The launcher handles authentication, asset downloading,
version management, and spawns the client with the appropriate flags.

## Building

Before building, you must have [just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed.
The Rust toolchain is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`; rustup picks it up.

### Client

Requires the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) and Python (to stage
OpenAL Soft next to the binary; without it the client runs with audio disabled).

Clone with submodules, since singleplayer builds SteelMC by default:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/PommeMC/Client.git
# or, on an existing clone
git submodule update --init
```

SteelMC's first build downloads the Minecraft server jar and generates registry
source, so expect it to take a while. To skip building it (the submodule must
still be checked out):

```bash
just client-build --no-default-features
```

Otherwise:

```bash
just client-build --release
```

### Launcher

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

```bash
pnpm install
just launcher-build --release
```

## Running

### Via the launcher (recommended)

```bash
pnpm install
just launcher-dev
```

### Standalone client

Running the standalone client requires minecraft assets, for which you have 2 options:

1. Run the launcher and install the latest supported release. Then you can do:

   ```bash
   just client-dev -- --username Steve
   ```

2. If you're on linux, extract the vanilla 26.3 assets from `.minecraft/` to `reference/`:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p reference/assets/indexes
   mkdir -p reference/assets/objects
   mkdir -p reference/versions/26.3/extracted
   mkdir -p reference/game-dir

   # 34 is the asset index id for 26.3
   cp ~/.minecraft/assets/indexes/34.json reference/assets/indexes/26.3.json
   cp -r ~/.minecraft/assets/objects/. reference/assets/objects/
   cp ~/.minecraft/versions/26.3/26.3.jar reference/versions/26.3/
   unzip reference/versions/26.3/26.3.jar 'assets/*' -d reference/versions/26.3/extracted/
   ```

   Then you can run the client with:

   ```bash
   just client-dev -- --version 26.3 \
     --assets-dir $PWD/reference/assets \
     --versions-dir $PWD/reference/versions \
     --game-dir $PWD/reference/game-dir
   ```

## Development commands

Run `just` with no arguments to list every recipe. The common ones:

- `just client-dev` / `just client-build` / `just client-release`: run, build, or benchmark the client; flags forward after `--`, e.g. `just client-dev -- --username Steve`
- `just launcher-dev` / `just launcher-build`: run or bundle the launcher
- `just client-pre-pr` / `just launcher-pre-pr`: the fmt, clippy, and test checks CI enforces
- `just protogen` / `just registrygen` / `just knownpackgen` / `just blockgen` / `just stategen`: regenerate a version's packet-id, registry, known-pack, block-state, and per-state property tables from `reference/<version>/`; `stategen` runs vanilla's own code and needs JDK 25 (`just jdk=<bin dir> stategen`, Windows only)

### Render diagnostics

Paired-probe JSON, render traces, and `POMME_HELD_DRAW_PAYLOAD_TRACE=1` / `POMME_ITEM_ENTITY_TRACE=1` are opt-in diagnostics; normal gameplay does not read or require these files or hooks. `POMME_DROP_BOB_OFFSET` is a target-UUID-gated render-only comparison input; native age/partial and spin remain untouched. Legacy drop phase controls additionally require the single target UUID and are render-state-only diagnostic inputs, never production RNG changes. When removing this investigation, delete the paired-probe hooks in `app/probe.rs`, the probe-only `app/render_debug.rs` module and its `app/mod.rs` declaration, renderer trace arms/accessors (`probe_actual_draw_trace`, `probe_held_item_pipeline_trace`, `probe_item_entity_pipeline_trace`, `debug_held_draw_payload` and their `arm_*` callers), plus the Java drop/held mixins and `HeldItemTrace`, paired-run scripts, and `Client/diagnostic/drop-stone-*` tools together. Keep production render paths independent of diagnostic JSON.

//! Wire translation for non-native protocol versions.
//!
//! The client speaks 26.2 natively (`pomme_protocol::version::NATIVE`). When
//! a connection negotiates a different wire version, inbound frames are
//! rewritten into the native layout before azalea's typed decode where the
//! wire format changed, and static-registry ids (which shift between versions)
//! are remapped in both directions so the rest of the client stays
//! single-version. Layouts were line-checked against the decompiled
//! references (`reference/<version>/decompiled/.../network/protocol/`).
//!
//! 26.3 -> 26.2 wire changes (the first version above native; its frames
//! translate down):
//! - `post_effects` was inserted at configuration clientbound 10 and game
//!   clientbound 83, `add_transient_block` at 37 and `swing_animation` at 123,
//!   shifting every later id; serverbound `swing` (63) became the payload-less,
//!   main-hand-only `punch` (46). `post_effects` and `add_transient_block` have
//!   no native equivalent and drop through the id map
//! - `move_entity_pos`/`move_entity_pos_rot` pack onGround and a step count
//!   into a `properties` varint and carry a `VecDelta` (one short triple, or
//!   per-step `ticks` + triple), collapsed to the summed displacement;
//!   `move_entity_rot` moved onGround ahead of the rotation bytes
//! - `entity_position_sync` replaced the position and delta doubles with a
//!   `PositionPath` (a `Vec3`, or a counted list of `Vec3` + tick-offset steps
//!   ending at the last); a zero delta is synthesized
//! - `level_particles` leads with the particle, splits `maxSpeed` per axis,
//!   sends `count` as a varint and appends a randomization type; particle
//!   payloads are sized per option codec (byte-identical to 26.2's), so
//!   block-state, dust and item particles translate on this version
//! - `CommonPlayerSpawnInfo` (`login`, `respawn`) sends `previousGameType` as
//!   an optional varint (0 = none, else id + 1) where 26.2 reads a signed byte
//! - `animate` lost its swing actions to `swing_animation` (`entityId, hand,
//!   {type, duration}`, rewritten back onto `animate`) and renumbered the rest
//!   (wake up 0, critical hit 1, magic critical hit 2)
//! - `update_advancements` moved each advancement's screen position out of
//!   `DisplayInfo` to a float pair after the entry
//! - `explode` appended a `playSound` bool
//! - `EntityDataSerializers` appended `dye_color` (43), used only by the
//!   cushion, whose entity type (like the poplar boats) has no native id;
//!   `data_component_type` diverges from 40 (`swing_animation` and `map_color`
//!   removed, thirteen components added), and `pot_decorations`, inline trim
//!   materials and instruments, and `teleport_randomly` changed their value
//!   layout (patches carrying them can't be sized)
//! - `ByteBufCodecs.BIT_SET` (a byte array) replaced the long-array bitset in
//!   the light masks (`level_chunk_with_light`, `light_update`) and the
//!   `player_chat` partial filter mask
//! - `commands` inserted five singleton argument types (the parser ids are
//!   remapped by name; the 26.3-only ones become the parser 26.2 sent)
//! - the `tag` slot display carries a `HolderSet` rather than a tag id, and
//!   26.3 routes every ingredient through it (`recipe_book_add`,
//!   `place_ghost_recipe`, `update_recipes`)
//! - serverbound `player_action` inserted `CHANGE_DESTROY_DIRECTION` at 1,
//!   which pomme never sends (it only steers the server's new destroy-progress
//!   level events, 2019/2020, which drop client-side); `sign_update` reordered
//!   its slot field (pomme never sends it)
//! - `accept_teleportation` appends the accepted pose, and 26.3's
//!   `handleMovePlayer` no longer follows it with a `move_player_pos_rot` (a
//!   second position packet in one tick disconnects): the accept is held and
//!   folded together with the PosRot pomme sends right after it
//! - `punch` is sent only for attacks; use swings are server-side
//!   (`reports_use_swings`)
//! - TODO: 26.3 skips applying a teleport to a passenger and sends
//!   `ABORT_DESTROY_BLOCK` after one; pomme does neither
//! - `move_vehicle`, `open_sign_editor`, the chunk sections and the item and
//!   component-patch codecs are byte-identical
//!
//! 26.1 -> 26.2 wire changes:
//! - login `login_finished` gained a trailing session-id UUID
//! - game `login` gained an `onlineMode` bool before the trailing
//!   `enforcesSecureChat` bool; older clients prepared a chat key pair on an
//!   encrypted connection instead, so the game loop substitutes that
//! - game `set_player_team` reordered its `Parameters` fields and turned the
//!   color from a `ChatFormatting` ordinal into an `Optional<TeamColor>`
//! - serverbound slot 62 was replaced (`spectate_entity` ->
//!   `spectator_action`); pomme sends neither
//!
//! 1.21.11 -> 26.2 wire changes (all of the above — 1.21.11 matches 26.1 on
//! those three layouts — plus):
//! - game packet ids diverge in both directions (handshake/status/login/
//!   configuration ids and layouts are identical), so frames get an id remap at
//!   the edge; every 1.21.11 packet still exists in 26.2 under the same name,
//!   and no other clientbound layout changed
//! - `set_entity_data` serializer ids shifted (26.x interleaved four
//!   `*_sound_variant` serializers into `EntityDataSerializers`), and particle
//!   values carry type ids in the wire version's registry space, remapped in
//!   place
//! - each chunk section in `level_chunk_with_light` gained a `fluidCount` short
//!   after `nonEmptyBlockCount`
//! - `set_time` replaced `dayTime`/`tickDayTime` with a world-clock map
//! - serverbound `attack` split out of `interact`, which now always carries the
//!   hand and a low-precision hit location; 26.2-only serverbound packets
//!   without an equivalent (`set_game_rule`, `spectator_action`) are suppressed
//!
//! 1.21.10 -> 26.2 wire changes (identical to 1.21.11's — the packet layouts
//! didn't change between the two — except):
//! - clientbound 40 is `horse_screen_open`, which 1.21.11 renamed
//!   `mount_screen_open` with identical fields; the id match aliases the pair
//! - `EntityDataSerializers` lacks 1.21.11's `zombie_nautilus_variant` (28) and
//!   trailing `humanoid_arm`, so the serializer remap differs
//!
//! 1.21.8 -> 26.2 wire changes (all of 1.21.10's plus 1.21.9's, which the id
//! remap and the rewrites below absorb):
//! - `add_entity` carried the velocity as three trailing shorts (1/8000 block
//!   per tick); 1.21.9 moved it to an `LpVec3` after the position.
//!   `set_entity_motion` made the same shorts -> `LpVec3` switch
//! - `player_rotation` gained a relative-rotation bool after each angle
//! - `set_default_spawn_position` went from `BlockPos + angle` to `RespawnData`
//!   (`GlobalPos`, yaw, pitch); the old packet has no dimension, so the
//!   overworld is synthesized
//! - `explode` gained `radius` and `blockCount` after the center and a trailing
//!   weighted block-particle list, and its particle and sound ids are remapped
//! - `EntityDataSerializers` still had `compound_tag` (16), which 1.21.9
//!   removed; entries using it (player shoulder parrots) are stripped, and
//!   every id from `particle` up shifts
//! - the `profile` item component was a bare name/uuid/properties triple, which
//!   1.21.9 wrapped in `ResolvableProfile` (full/partial profile either plus a
//!   skin patch)
//! - the clientbound `debug_*`/`game_test_highlight_pos` packets don't exist
//!   yet (pure id shifts); serverbound 22 was renamed
//!   (`debug_sample_subscription` -> `debug_subscription_request`), which pomme
//!   never sends
//!
//! 1.21.6 -> 26.2: identical to 1.21.8's translation. 1.21.7 changed no
//! packet layout, id, or serializer (the decompiled `network/protocol`
//! trees and `EntityDataSerializers` are byte-identical); it only added the
//! lava_chicken music disc item and sound, absorbed by the registry remap.
//!
//! 1.21.5 -> 26.2 wire changes (all of 1.21.8's — the pre-1.21.9 rewrites
//! and serializer set carry over unchanged — plus):
//! - 1.21.6 appended its dialog/waypoint clientbound packets and inserted
//!   `change_game_mode`/`custom_click_action` serverbound; the id remap absorbs
//!   the shifts and `change_game_mode` (which doesn't exist yet) is suppressed
//! - serverbound `player_command` still opens its action enum with
//!   PRESS/RELEASE_SHIFT_KEY, so newer action ordinals sit two higher
//! - `change_difficulty` read an unsigned byte where 1.21.6 reads a varint;
//!   difficulty ids fit a single byte either way, so the wire bytes are
//!   identical
//! - 1.21.6 gave `HangingEntity` a synched `direction` at index 8, so an item
//!   frame's item/rotation sit at 8/9 here and a painting's variant at 8 (9/10
//!   and 9 on 26.2); the walker passes index bytes through unremapped and pomme
//!   renders neither entity, so the shift is left in place
//!
//! 1.21.4 -> 26.2 wire changes (all of 1.21.5's plus):
//! - chunk heightmaps were a network-NBT compound of named long arrays; 1.21.5
//!   packed them into a (type id, long array) list
//! - `player_chat` gained a leading `globalIndex` varint; zero is synthesized
//! - serverbound `chat`'s and `chat_command_signed`'s last-seen update gained a
//!   trailing checksum byte in 1.21.5; it is stripped
//! - `update_advancements` gained a trailing `showAdvancements` bool; true is
//!   synthesized
//! - team `Parameters` carried nametag visibility and collision rule as
//!   strings, turned into enum ids by 1.21.5
//! - serverbound `container_click` carried full item stacks for the changed
//!   slots and carried item where 1.21.5 hashes them; the hashes can't be
//!   reversed, so bare component-less stacks are reconstructed (the server
//!   reconciles any mismatch by resyncing the slots)
//! - `EntityDataSerializers` had no cow/pig/chicken/wolf-sound variants and
//!   `optional_uuid` where 1.21.5 has `optional_living_entity_reference`
//!   (wire-identical); `compound_tag` sits at 16 like 1.21.8, stripped the same
//!   way
//! - `add_experience_orb` has no newer equivalent and pomme renders no XP orbs;
//!   the frame is dropped, like `add_entity` for the thrown `potion` entity
//!   1.21.5 split into splash/lingering
//! - serverbound `set_creative_mode_slot` wrote item component values bare,
//!   where 1.21.5 length-prefixes each one
//!   (`ItemStack.OPTIONAL_UNTRUSTED_STREAM_CODEC`); untranslated — see the
//!   azalea-divergence list
//!
//! 1.21.3 -> 26.2 wire changes (all of 1.21.4's plus):
//! - `level_particles` lacks the `alwaysShow` bool 1.21.4 inserted after
//!   `overrideLimiter`; false is synthesized
//! - `player_info_update`'s action mask passes through unchanged: 1.21.4
//!   appended UPDATE_HAT after UPDATE_LIST_ORDER rather than inserting it, so
//!   every older mask is a prefix of 26.2's, and `writeFixedBitSet` is one byte
//!   at 6, 7 and 8 actions alike
//! - serverbound `move_vehicle` lacks the trailing onGround bool and 1.21.4
//!   split `pick_item` into the from_block/from_entity pair; the pair is
//!   suppressed quietly below 769 (TODO: port the slot-based `pick_item`)
//! - clientbound `set_held_slot` reads a byte where 26.2 reads a varint; hotbar
//!   slots encode identically
//!
//! 1.21.1 -> 26.2 wire changes (the 1.21.2 rework; all of 1.21.3's plus):
//! - `player_position` and `teleport_entity` predate PositionMoveRotation:
//!   positions reorder, rotations un-pack (teleport carried packed-degree
//!   bytes), and a zero delta is synthesized. Both versions resolve that delta
//!   against the relative bits, so `player_position` mirrors each position bit
//!   into its `DELTA_*` bit and `teleport_entity` rewrites onto
//!   `entity_position_sync`, whose handler leaves velocity alone as 1.21.1's
//!   did — without either, an old server's syncs zero the velocity
//! - `set_time` is two longs with a negated dayTime marking a frozen clock
//! - CommonPlayerSpawnInfo lacks the trailing `seaLevel` varint, inserted
//!   before the final byte of `login` and `respawn`
//! - `container_set_slot` reads a signed-byte container id whose -1/-2
//!   sentinels became `set_cursor_item`/`set_player_inventory`
//! - older `cooldown` packets carry an item registry id; they are normalized to
//!   the 26.2 cooldown-group Identifier form before raw cooldown handling
//! - clientbound `set_carried_item` was renamed `set_held_slot` (identical byte
//!   layout); login `game_profile` -> `login_finished` needs no alias (login
//!   rewrites dispatch by id) but ends in a `strictErrorHandling` bool 1.21.2
//!   dropped, stripped before the session UUID is appended
//! - `update_recipes` and `place_ghost_recipe` restructured into 26.2's
//!   `RecipeDisplay` trees with no mechanical mapping, so they're dropped and
//!   the recipe book/stonecutter UIs stay empty on 1.21.1 servers (the
//!   1.21.1-only `recipe` packet drops via the id map); `explode` is dropped
//!   too, but only for want of a rewriter, so no explosions render either
//! - every attribute was renamed by dropping its category prefix
//!   (`generic.armor` -> `armor`), handled by the registry-remap alias;
//!   `boat`/`chest_boat` entities split per wood type and have no 26.2 ids, so
//!   boats aren't rendered
//! - serverbound `player_input` was the vehicle-steering packet (two axis
//!   floats + jump/shift flags) rather than the key bitfield, and the
//!   move_player flags byte was a plain onGround bool, so the
//!   horizontal-collision bit 1.21.2 added must be dropped. 1.21.1 sent
//!   `player_input` only while riding and pomme sends it every tick, but
//!   `ServerPlayer.setPlayerInput` is guarded by `isPassenger()`, so the
//!   unmounted frames are discarded server-side
//! - `client_tick_end` doesn't exist; its suppression is expected and logged
//!   quietly
//! - `AbstractArrow` gained `in_ground` at index 10, so an arrow sends its
//!   effect color at 10 and a trident its loyalty/foil at 10/11, where 26.2
//!   reads 11 and 11/12. The indices pass through unshifted, which costs
//!   nothing while pomme reads metadata only for living entities; a lift
//!   belongs beside `normalize_player_index_at` in `entity/mod.rs`
//!
//! 1.20.6 -> 26.2 wire changes (all of 1.21.1's — 1.21 only appended
//! `custom_report_details`/`server_links`, so the tables are a strict
//! prefix and every pre-1.21.2 rewrite carries over — plus):
//! - `update_attributes` modifier ids were UUIDs, turned into resource
//!   locations by 1.21; a hex name is synthesized (pomme reads only the
//!   attribute values)
//! - `projectile_power` carried a per-axis acceleration vector, collapsed to
//!   its magnitude
//! - serverbound `use_item` lacks the rotation floats 1.21 appended
//! - the damage/effect/dimension holder codecs merely moved into their types
//!   (wire-identical), and the block set matches 1.21.1's
//! - `horse_screen_open`'s middle varint changed meaning rather than layout:
//!   1.20.6 sends the container's slot count where 1.21 sends the mount's
//!   inventory column count (`columns = (size - 1) / 3` — 1 for a plain horse,
//!   16 for a chested donkey, `1 + 3c` for a llama). Passed through untouched,
//!   which costs nothing while pomme has no mount-inventory screen
//!
//! 1.20.4 -> 26.2 wire changes (the 1.20.5 item-component rework; all of
//! 1.20.6's plus):
//! - items are `bool + id + byte count + NBT`; inbound stacks translate the
//!   legacy root into `custom_data` (retaining unknown NBT) and convert exact
//!   `Damage`, `RepairCost`, `Unbreakable`, `CustomModelData`,
//!   `CustomPotionColor`, `Potion` (known builtin potion IDs), `BlockStateTag`
//!   (string properties), `display.color`, `display.Name`, `display.Lore` and
//!   `display.LocName` fields to native components when uniquely typed.
//!   Other/invalid/duplicate fields remain in `custom_data`. Complete
//!   Enchantments/StoredEnchantments lists use the server's configuration
//!   enchantment registry ids. Custom potion effects (numeric pre-datafix
//!   effect IDs), adventure block predicates (block holder-set codec), trim and
//!   UUID-backed attribute modifiers remain in custom_data. Merchant costs have
//!   no component patch and outbound `container_click`/`set_creative_mode_slot`
//!   still use bare stacks
//! - the configuration phase diverges for the first time: ids remap, and the
//!   single whole-holder NBT `registry_data` packet fans out into the
//!   per-registry form (entries reordered by their explicit ids, which the
//!   client equates with wire order); the dimension-type order is kept for the
//!   spawn-info rewrites, whose dimension type is a resource key string at 765
//! - login-phase `hello` lacks the shouldAuthenticate bool (synthesized true)
//!   and game `login` lacks enforcesSecureChat
//! - `update_attributes` keys attributes by resource location and
//!   `update_mob_effect` has a byte amplifier plus trailing factor NBT
//! - `level_particles` leads with the particle type id; `chat_command` is
//!   always the signed form (empty signatures appended), so
//!   `chat_command_signed` goes out as it, checksum stripped
//! - `update_advancements` drops (old-form icons nested in display data);
//!   serializer ids from `particles` (18) up shift
//! - `player_chat`/`disguised_chat` carry a direct chat-type registry id where
//!   1.20.5 put a holder (bumped by one on the way through)
//!
//! 1.20.2 -> 26.2 wire changes (all of 1.20.4's plus; the pre-1.20.3 era):
//! - text components are length-prefixed JSON strings, not NBT
//!   (`FriendlyByteBuf.writeComponent`); `component_pass` transcodes every
//!   consumed component field via `json_to_nbt` (mixed arrays normalize to
//!   compound lists) and the entity-data component serializers (5/6) transcode
//!   in the metadata walk — `server_data` and `map_item_data` drop instead
//!   (pomme never reads them)
//! - `set_score` carries a method byte (its REMOVE arm becomes the
//!   `reset_score` packet 1.20.3 added) and no display/numberFormat;
//!   `set_objective` ends at the render type
//! - one `resource_pack` packet serves both phases: it maps to
//!   `resource_pack_push` with a synthesized zero UUID, and the serverbound
//!   reply drops its UUID and clamps post-1.20.2 action values
//! - everything else — items, registry_data, spawn info, login, chunks,
//!   serializer order — matches 1.20.4 exactly (the diff is tiny)
//! - the `LEVEL_CHUNKS_LOAD_START` game event (13) doesn't exist yet (1.20.4
//!   added it), so the level load tracker treats the level as started at login
//!   instead of waiting for it (see `AppCore::tick_level_load`)
//!
//! 1.20.1 -> 26.2 wire changes (all of 1.20.2's plus; 1.20 shares them):
//! - there is no configuration phase, so the join sends no `login_acknowledged`
//!   and reads the registries out of the game `login` packet, which carries the
//!   whole codec inline; the brand and `client_information` move to the game
//!   phase, where 1.20.1's `ClientPacketListener.handleLogin` sends them.
//!   `login` itself predates `CommonPlayerSpawnInfo`, so its fields reorder
//!   (`portalCooldown` already exists), and `respawn` carried `dataToKeep`
//!   mid-packet rather than last
//! - NBT roots are written with an empty name (`FriendlyByteBuf.writeNbt` went
//!   through `NbtIo.write`, where 1.20.2 switched to `writeAnyTag`), so item
//!   tags, entity `compound_tag` values, chunk heightmaps, every chunk block
//!   entity and the `block_entity_data` / `tag_query` tags carry two extra
//!   bytes the native readers don't expect
//! - `add_player` spawned other players; 1.20.2 dropped it for `add_entity`,
//!   which the frame is rewritten onto (yaw and pitch swap, the head yaw
//!   repeats the yaw, and the data and velocity fields are zero)
//! - `forget_level_chunk` sent two ints where 1.20.2 packs a `ChunkPos` long,
//!   whose big-endian halves put z first
//! - serverbound login `hello` wrapped its profile id in an optional, which
//!   1.20.2 made mandatory
//! - `update_enabled_features` is a game packet here (1.20.2 moved it into
//!   configuration) and drops through the id map; `update_tags` stayed a game
//!   packet, 1.20.2 only adding a configuration copy beside it. Pomme reads
//!   neither. `update_advancements` still nests its criteria map, but the 765
//!   gate already drops the packet for its old-form icons
//! - `set_display_objective` wrote a byte where 1.20.2 writes a varint; every
//!   slot id is under 128, so the bytes match. Every other packet 1.20.2
//!   touched (`player_info_update`, `merchant_offers`, `set_equipment`,
//!   `map_item_data`, `update_recipes`, `player_chat`, the chunk framing) was
//!   refactored without changing its layout
//!
//! Known limitation (accepted): an inbound item stack carrying a data
//! component at/after the first id the versions number differently (26.3:
//! 40, where 26.3 replaced `swing_animation` with `attack_animation`; 26.1:
//! 78, where 26.2 inserted `sulfur_cube_content`; 1.21.11: 41, where 26.x
//! inserted `additional_trade_cost`; 1.21.10 and every older version with a
//! component registry: 5, where 1.21.11 inserted `use_effects` — so even
//! `custom_name` and `enchantments` are affected on all of them) decodes under
//! the wrong 26.2 codec — usually a misparse that skips the packet via
//! `skip_malformed_packet`, though a coincidentally parsable layout yields a
//! silently wrong component. Common survival items only use earlier, unshifted
//! components. Items nested inside component values (bundles, containers) also
//! keep their source-version ids. On 26.3 a stack carrying one of the
//! components whose value layout changed (`pot_decorations`, inline `trim` or
//! `instrument`, a `teleport_randomly` consume effect) misdecodes the same
//! way, and recipe displays keep their items in wire space.
//!
//! Depends on azalea diverging from 26.2: these translations are correct only
//! because azalea encodes or decodes something differently from the reference,
//! so fixing azalea — or replacing it with pomme's own codec — breaks the older
//! versions unless the matching rewrite lands at the same time. Each site
//! carries a `TODO` pointing here.
//! - inbound `set_player_team` copies the color through as a plain
//!   `ChatFormatting` ordinal, where 26.2 writes an `Optional<TeamColor>`
//! - outbound `set_creative_mode_slot` leaves component values undelimited,
//!   which is 1.21.4's layout rather than 26.2's
//! - inbound legacy `cooldown` carries an item registry id and is normalized to
//!   the 26.2 cooldown-group Identifier payload
